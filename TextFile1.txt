Need function so that all fields can be completed. 

Need functions for Address ID


6-22 left off with function to populate countries in addCustomerdrop down. Need to use the newly created dict to populate the form.


6-23 lef tof on app.cs like 150


//to do, add logic for getting city ID or adding city to database.  Check the rubric here, maybe users cant add city just pick one?

// added ability to get city id on new customer submission to do create required text boxes and input validation on form.

// added validation for zip and phone todo validation for name address

7-6 added modify customer functionality ToDo: test it then move on



7-15 todo: the foreign keys (i think ) need to be updated in the table where they are primary keys. So add in code to do that for userID and customerID. I think it should be two more sql calls when the saved button is clicked.
